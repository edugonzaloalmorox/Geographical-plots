# Plot maps 

This repository explains how to produce a map and plot other data from an external source. The final aim is to represent entries in market of care homes in England. 
 
The repository is composed by a script and various datasets for carrying out the analysis. The scripts deal with geographical information contained in a shape file and information regarding the care homes market. The former is obtained from the Geographical Portal of the Office of National Statistics in England and the latter is obtained from the Care Quality Commission registry of (un)active care homes. 

### Analysis

There are two parts in the analysis: the calculation of entry rates `entry_exit_rates.R` and the management of geographical information. The latter is given in shape (`.shp`) file.
